                    <p>George Lucas may be the creative visionary behind iconic film franchises, Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but he is also known as one of the greatest innovators in the industry of film and television <a href = "references.html">(“George Lucas”)</a>.</p>

                    <p>In 1975, George Lucas founded the company Industrial Light &amp; Magic, commonly referred to as ILM. Lucas created ILM to work on the first Star Wars movie, creating groundbreaking visual effects to tell an immersive story. ILM continued to work on VFX for films unrelated to Star Wars, becoming the Oscar-winning go-to for any visual effects work in the industry. By the late 1990s, ILM technology was spearheading a new digital age of filmmaking, such as digital compositing and recording. In the last 20 years, ILM has expanded across the world with offices in Vancouver, London, Singapore, and Sydney, to name a few.</p>
