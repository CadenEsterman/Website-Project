                    <p>In recent years, ILM&apos;s most impactful innovative project is The Volume. The Volume was constructed at ILM with help from Epic Games. It is an LED curved video screen that is 21ft tall and 75ft long, capable of rendering 3D environments around a stage. It can recreate any location with realistic lighting and depth, removing the need for location shooting. One feature that it has is the ability to completely enclose the team and the actors in the environment, spanning a complete 360 degrees around them <a href = "references.html">(Jensen, 2022)</a>.</p>

                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <div class = "text-left-cont">
                    <p id = "volume-how">While the practice of placing actors in front of digital backgrounds is nothing new, The Volume can alter the background in real-time during a shot, using Unreal Engine and Helios technologies. Virtual backgrounds are created prior to filming using CGI, real footage of an environment, or both. Using Unreal Engine, the background can change while a shot is being filmed. This includes the lighting, object layering, and positioning of the background itself. The background can also be linked to the camera movement, adding to the realism of the shot. 
                        For most movies and TV shows made nowadays, green or blue screens are used to add in a digital backdrop behind the actors. All the green screen effects are created in post-production, which is a lengthy and difficult process. In comparison to The Volume, backdrops are created in pre-production, the lighting syncs up with the actors on set, and the actors are immersed further in the world they interact with.
